# Dollar Words

### Words Corpus
  I am using `words_dictionary.json` from [https://github.com/dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) for the list of words.

### Usage
  Run the `dollarwords.js` file to generate the list. Change the first two lines in `dollarwords.js` to configure the script. It should work without modification using any JSON word list that has an object with each word as the key.
